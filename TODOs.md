Current known to dos and issues:

MAIN ISSUE:
By moving the scripts onto the GitHub the paths are most likely broken.
Plot_output currently contains the outputs for all of the runs, maybe keep only some as examples?

TODOs:
Need to move and cluster toghether most of the functions in single scripts.
Need to merge the model and satellire reading scripts in a single extensive script.
This needs to be put in the home.
Check for corner cases in the functions: they need to be as general as possible.
Need to build the pytest files.
Need to add asserts to check that the shape of the data is kept intact.
Need to build a log file with timer.

Known bugs:
To expand upon.
