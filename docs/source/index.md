# Hydrological Model Validator

This project provides a set of tools for evaluating the performance of Bio-Geo-Hydrological simulations and analyzing their outputs.

The focus of this repository is on **post-processing**, offering utilities to:

- Clean and pre-process relevant dataframes
- Interpolate observed datasets to handle missing values and apply proper masking
- Compare observed and simulated outputs for validation and performance assessment
- Analyse the simulation outputs for further insights

---

## Features

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Missing data interpolation and masking
- Automated validation metrics and visual comparison
- Optional PDF report generation
- Modular structure for customizable analysis workflows

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main objectives:

1. **Quick-Use Toolkit**  
   A high-level interface that allows users to input datasets and automatically generate:
   - Validation plots
   - Summary dataframes
   - A PDF report (optional)

2. **Modular Subcomponents**  
   A collection of standalone functions and classes for users who prefer to build custom analysis pipelines or integrate specific components into other projects.
   These are collected into 3 submodules, which can both be used as standalones or combined:
    - **`Processing/`**: Functions for reading, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing input datasets.
    - **`Plotting/`**: Tools for generating a variety of plots from the processed results, including time series, scatter plots, and performance metrics.
    - **`Report/`**: Utilities for creating structured PDF reports, incorporating plots, summary statistics, and metadata.

> **Note:** This repository is part of a **Physics of the Earth System** thesis and may be expanded in the future to include additional variables and more advanced analytical features.

### Model/Simulation Evaluation

The current evaluation approach is based on a **direct comparison** between simulated and observed datasets over the same time window. The results are presented through a variety of plots and statistical performance metrics.

#### Analytical Tools

The following visualization and statistical tools are used to evaluate model performance:

- **Time Series & Scatter Plots**
  - General time series plots for visual inspection
  - Seasonal scatter plots for intra-annual trends

- **Distribution Plots**
  - Box-and-whisker plots
  - Violin plots

- **Multivariate Performance Plots**
  - Target diagrams
  - Taylor diagrams

- **Efficiency Metrics**
  A wide set of statistical coefficients is implemented to evaluate model accuracy:

  - **Coefficient of Determination (R¬≤)**
    - Standard
    - Weighted

  - **Index of Agreement (d)**
    - Standard
    - Modified
    - Relative

  - **Nash‚ÄìSutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)**
    - Standard
    - Logarithmic
    - Modified
    - Relative

- **Error Decomposition**
  - **Time-series and Spectral Analysis**
    - Compared against cloud coverage patterns
  - **Spatial Performance Mapping**
    - Annual and monthly resolution maps showing model performance across geographic regions

---

### Expansion of the Analysis: Bottom (Benthic) œÉ-Layer

As the **first direction for expanded analysis**, this repository introduces tools focused on the **extraction and study of the bottom œÉ-layer** of the simulation grid. This layer is particularly relevant for investigating the **formation of deep water masses** and the **distribution of bio-geochemical variables** near the seabed.

Once the model has been validated using the core evaluation tools, users can apply these modules to explore processes such as:

- Stratification and mixing at depth  
- Tracer evolution in deep layers (e.g., nutrients, oxygen, carbon compounds)  
- Temporal variability in bottom water properties

> For implementation details and example workflows, refer to the test cases provided in the `Test_cases/` directory.

<details>
<summary><strong>MATLAB Setup (All Systems)</strong></summary>

### Description

Some test cases or post-analysis steps may require MATLAB. Make sure it's installed and available via your system's PATH.

üîó [Official MATLAB Installation Guide](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/)
</details>

To correctly run the interpolator, the toolboxes **m_map**, **mexcdf**, and **nctoolbox** need to be accessible by the script. Please make sure that their paths are reachable by your MATLAB installation. For a guide on how to add paths in MATLAB, please refer to [MATLAB Add Folder to Path Documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html).

The usage of a MATLAB interpolator is to make the process NOAA compliant by using their same tools, allowing future integration of this repository with other [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) tools.

## Test Case Scripts

These are **step-by-step, verbose scripts** that demonstrate how to apply the tools for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting. They are ideal for understanding the intended usage.

### Available Test Cases

- **`Data_cleaner_setupper.py`**  
  Demonstrates how to clean and prepare datasets for analysis.  
  Includes the MATLAB script **`Interpolator_v2.m`** to perform bilinear interpolation on observed datasets.

- **`SST_data_analyzer.py` & `CHL_data_analyzer.py`**  
  Practical examples of analysis workflows using **Sea Surface Temperature** and **Chlorophyll-a** datasets.  
  These are simplified and didactical illustrations of what the `Report_generator` submodule automates.

- **`Benthic_layer.py`**  
  Focuses on extracting and analyzing **bottom œÉ-layers**, emphasizing **dense water formation** and **bio-geochemical tracers** near the seabed.

---

## Pytests and Code Quality

Automated testing ensures reliability and stability of the modules, using:

- [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
- [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) (for linting and style enforcement)

You can run them via:

```bash
pytest
flake8 src/
```

These tools verify logic correctness, class behavior, and code style compliance.
