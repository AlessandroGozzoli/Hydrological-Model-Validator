# Hydrological Model Validator

## Overview

This project is designed to **read, interpolate, and analyze** Hydrological-Geochemical model data, enabling **validation against satellite observations**.

It is developed as part of a thesis project and may be extended with additional analysis methods in the future.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

### 1. Data Setup
- Identification of missing data
- Interpolation using either:
  - Satellite data
    - Model data
    - Computation of Basin Averages

    ### 2. Data Analysis & Validation

    #### Analysis Tools:
    - Time series plotting
    - Bias plotting
    - Scatter plots

    #### Validation Tools:
    - Taylor diagrams
    - Target plots
    - Coefficient of Determination
    - **Weighted** Coefficient of Determination
    - Index of Agreement
    - Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency
